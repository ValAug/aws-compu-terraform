# Purpose

Shows how to use AWS with Terraform to accomplish the following tasks:

* How to build multiple different type of AWS EC2-AMIs __dynamically__

# Prerequisites

* You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured
* You must have Terraform installed


# Cautions

* As an AWS best practice, grant this code least privilege, or only the 
  permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see 
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) 
  in the *AWS Identity and Access Management 
  User Guide*.
* This code has been tested in us-west-1 AWS Regions only. However it should work in any other region. 
* Running this code __it will__ result in charges to your AWS account.

  - [Quick Start](#quick-start)
  - [Quick Destroy](#quick-destroy)
  - [Notes](#notes)

## Quick Start

It will deploy to the account setup for the aws cli called 'default'

```bash
cd aws-compu-terraform
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

## Quick Destroy

```bash
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

## Notes

- clone this Git repo
- cd to the the directory aws-compu-terraform.
- use terraform __init__ command to initialize the Terraform working directory and to download plugins for a provider (aws)
- terraform validate command will validate the code before actual deployment
- terraform plan command will show the execution code before making the actual deployment
- terraform apply
- Alternate command : terraform apply -auto-approve
- terraform destroy
- Alternate command : terraform destroy -auto-approve
- terraform fmt -recursive # A way to format the terraform code
